In fact, there was not much to do around but lay on a hammock and read books📖. I believe we were only 2 foreigners in the whole island, as the next morning I was notified that the other girl was leaving and I should leave too or who knows when another boat would come🤷🏻‍♂️\nI joined her to go to Don Det where I stumbled upon my French friends Lisa and Tanguy. We stayed in Mama Tanon\u0026rsquo;s, a friendly local lady\u0026rsquo;s guesthouse, where we spent most of our days lying down in mats with views to the river, eating cheap food and drinking fruit shakes🍍.\nOne of those days, we rented bicycles and rode around Don Det and Don Khong. It was a hot day and the beaches that we were expecting to find were quite dirty. When we returned to our bungalows I was so thirsty and hungry that I decided to buy a watermelon and eat the whole thing in one sitting🍉. Not the best idea, and not the best night (search Watermelon side effects for more details💩).\nThe last day, we booked a kayaking tour around the 4000 island of the Mekong, we sightsee the last Irrawaddy dolphins of the area and the sacred waterfalls Phapheng Waterfall (brief story in the comments).\nAs we were leaving to Cambodia, Mama Tanon had made bracelets for us to wish us luck. Little did I know\u0026hellip;🤦‍♂️\nIn the middle of the river, next to the waterfall there used to be a tree, Manikhot. This historic and sacred tree, has been staying in Khone Phapheng Falls for more than 2,000 years until it’s dead on 19th March 2012.\nThe reason was unknown. Lao people believed that the tree is able to give life and death. It’s believed that the core of Manikhoth can make things die and the top part of the tree can bring dead things back to life.\nEvery Buddha days from October to March, there are a bunch of white egrets flying around Manikhoth tree three rounds before landing on the branches and trees nearby. It’s said that the egrets are showing respect. After its death in 2012, the Manikhoth could not be brought up from the water due to the heavy flow of water in Khone Phapheng Falls.\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"1ac202d73aa675ecc242676e4f2e028a","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/2laos/4000islands/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/2laos/4000islands/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"DAY 25: 4000 Islands (21/03/19) My last stop in Laos was Si Phan Don a.k.a.

As we learned in \u0026ldquo;Into the wild\u0026rdquo;:\n -Happiness is only real when shared.\n During the flight from Moscow to Thailand I could not sleep and the plane was quite crappy. However, it may have been for the better, because that helped me to meet who would soon become my first travel buddy , Tessa, even before having to reach Thailand. The excitement didn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to sleep much the first night (neither the 2th or 3th, so maybe the jet lag also had a bit to do with it). At 6am I was ready to start solo exploring the city. From the very first moment that I put a foot on the street (especially around the infamous area of #KhaoSan Rd) tens of \u0026ldquo;tuk-tuk\u0026rdquo; drivers smell my fresh Bahts and attempt to catch my attention for an overpriced drive to the main sightseeing spots. Unfortunately for them I was well aware of their scamming strategies (or that is what I thought\u0026hellip; Just wait for a couple of days)\nFirst place I reached was the spectacular Grand Palace (#Wat Phra Kaew). One of the most famous landmarks of the city, which is as full of shiny and detailed \u0026ldquo;buildings\u0026rdquo;(chedais, prangs? I still cannot tell the correct name of these pointy things. I love them tho) as of tourists taking pictures. It was when I was trying to sneak my phone into the no-camera allowed temple of the Emerald Buddha, when I met a super friendly Turkish girl , Meliha. That means no video, but together we started our private photo-tour around the golden temples.\nWe walked toward the river, and Tess joined us for a boat tour. We passed by the majestic Wat Arum and stopped in China Town. After a good walk around the nicely decorated (chinese new year is coming) but overwhelming streets packed with small business where there is no room for pedestrians and still motorbikes manage to find a way through the crowds, we stopped for our first Thai street food. And in an attempt to spice things up I accidentally dropped a full spoon of chilly leaves\u0026hellip;\n After completing our tour through China Town we left the crowded streets and took another boat (for the ridiculous price of 0.2€) to cross the river and delight our senses with what it is my favorite temple so far, Wat Arum! It received the name after the Hindu God Aruna (God of the Sun), and it is really stunning how the detailed craftsmanship of the main \u0026ldquo;parang\u0026rdquo; glimmer reflecting the sunshine.\nDespite this was my first day of what it is going to be a long traveling experience, my mindset is still that of a short vacation in which I cannot waste anytime. Therefore, the rest of the afternoon we kept going from one temple to the next one. Some of the places to remark are the colorful setupas from Wat Pho and a 46 m reclining Buddha (longest in Thailand, maybe the world?).\nAfter exhausting most of the temples of Rattanakosin, we walked through Sananrom park direction to our hostels when we found a group of elderly Thai people dancing. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help myself and spontaneously jumped to dance with them. Unfortunately, when we were leaving they played the Gangnam Style, which would have been TOP to dance!!\nOnce it was dark we said byebye to Meliha and went back to KhaoSan Rd where I saw a guy selling fried bugs and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to try some. The big scorpion was 100 baths which I reduced to 50 (1.3€) using my underdeveloped haggling skills (I could have gotten a better price, but I\u0026rsquo;m still working on it). If you wonder how it tastes\u0026hellip; Quite tasteless, just crunchy and some kind of sandy texture. . So before calling it a day we met 2 friends of Tessa and ate the typical and delicious Pad Thai with some drinks while we planned what was next in day 2.\n BONUS: FAMILY in my backpack You can call me crazy, and probably you will be right. But after all their dedication and support, I wanted to share this big trip with my family. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t leave Spain but I decided to bring them with me\u0026hellip; in an unorthodox fashion.\nI have their souls under the protection of my backpack, always close to me. And in some of the most remarkable landmarks of my trip, I ask to my travel buddies or random people that there may be around, to become my family, so I can share with them these nice memories.\n Day 3: The Lucky Day (1/02/2019) After a futile attempt of making friends at my hostel, I decided to wander alone around the streets of Bangkok.\nAt some point,a friendly Thai guy approached me, and even though my Spider-senses were tingling, we engaged in a nice conversation. He told me about how today was \u0026ldquo;the lucky day\u0026rdquo; due to the anniversary of the King and something related to Buddha. Reason of all the yellow flags around the city. And to celebrate, all the temples were entry-free+there were specific tuk-tuks (with a yellow flag) subsidized to move people around the temples for only 40 Baht(~1€).\nBefore I could realize of what was going on, I was in one of this tuk-tuks heading towards an isolated area of the city where a \u0026ldquo;lucky-Buddha\u0026rdquo; was supposed to be.\nDuring the ride I was able to realize that something was off and I was in the middle of being scammed. My brain was racing to find a way to get out of there, when I just see another foreigner approaching.\nThe idea was to befriend him to have an excuse and leave the place without my tuk-tuk driver, when I realize this person was @jonnnyse the german guy that I just met the night before. It turns out he was in the middle of the same scam, and together we managed to figure out a way of escaping without upsetting our drivers.\nOnce we were out of the this tricky situation we went to visit more temples (which btw were not free), while laughing about what just happened to us and how odd had been to meet there.\nWe stop and chilled for a bit at the top of the Golden Mount where we met a group of friendly young people, gathered for a \u0026ldquo;United World\u0026rdquo; convention, who were very interested on talking to us.\nTo give end to our last day in Bangkok, Jonnie and I met with Tess and her friends to enjoy a red sky at the pier illuminated by the sunset, and we crossed the river for a last visit of Wat Arum at night.\nWe grabbed some dinner and went to the house by the river of a Western family that had invited us to drink with them. We played cards, took a dip at midnight in their outdoor swimming pool and said goodbye to each other as our paths separated next day.\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"e7c39b75f6e63aea45c216709a7db255","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/1thailand/bangkok/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/1thailand/bangkok/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"Day 1: My first day (29/01/2019) Before starting my trip I was very excited with the decision that I had taken of going for the solo mode adventure, but at the same a bit scared of ending up alone with no idea of what to do.

I knew for a fact that the real price was 30$ and they were just trying to scam tourists, but if you were persistent you could get away with the real price. It was not only about saving 10$, but a matter of principles of not letting them get away with these illegal actions.\nI let the people of my bus know what they were trying to do and most of us rallied together in a peaceful protest. They attempted to close the office window but 3 of us put our arms through to avoid that.\nI believe they were getting tired and were about to give in, when another bus packed with British people stopped by. This time the agent ask them from 50$, and they all paid🤦‍♂️. We tried to block the window so they could not get their passports before we got our stamps too, which resulted in an increased agitation of the border agents.\nFrom that moment, everything escalated quickly. At some point, they attempted to stab my hand with a pen so I removed my hand from the office window.\nWhich lead to me calling them a Mafia😤. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what that word triggered, but their eyes went crazy, they all left the office, came to me, pushed me around and grabbed me. Then they address to the group of people of my bus -\u0026ldquo;Either you pay now! Or we out your leader in a dark room\u0026rdquo;. For a couple of seconds, I got all excited about being called the leader and I was willing to take one for the team, and have one more experience to tell. But soon I remembered the stories of people who enter one of these prisons and never leave.\nWe all decided to pay, but when it was my turn, the officer catapulted my passport back to my face -\u0026ldquo;you not pass! You bad people\u0026rdquo;. What?😮\nNot knowing what to do I screamed to my group - \u0026ldquo;guys, they won\u0026rsquo;t let me pass, tell the bus driver to wait a bit for me\u0026rdquo;. The officers would not talk to me, so not know it what to do I sat down and started to read a book, to calm myself and show them I was not leaving.\nThirty minutes later, one of the agents came to me and told me my bus was going to leave, which meant I would lose way more than the 10$ they wanted to get from me, and that if I wanted to pass and get it I should \u0026ldquo;pull down my pants\u0026rdquo; and tell the other agents that \u0026ldquo;I was very sorry for all the troubles I had caused, that I am a horrible person, an awful tourist, and that I would behave properly and respect the laws of their country\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nAfter several hours fighting for our rights, I was exhausted, I swallowed my pride and agreed on their terms.

So I ignored all the tuk-tuk drivers that offered me a ride to the city and decided to walk for 7km.\nThe travesie was well worth, as when I was crossing the Nawarat bridge I got delighted by the first sunrise of my trip.\nI kept walking through the city, until I randomly found a nice looking hostel, where I would try to chill and do nothing for the rest of the morning.\nI was determined to shift my mindset from \u0026ldquo;I cannot stop moving for a second\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just chill and go with the flow\u0026rdquo;. But a happy coincidence just happened, @lilian, whom I had met before in Lopburi had also just arrived to Chiang Mai. That saved the day because I was really struggling at not doing anything. So we decided to meet and chill together.\nNumber one option to chill in Thailand\u0026hellip;go get a Thai massage! Specifically we went to an exprisoner women center, which is a great initiative to enable women that have been in jail to get a remunerated job.\nMy masseuse was a small young lady, but she had incredible strength and made me see the stars by pressuring key points of my legs and crunching every bone and muscle of my back.\nAfter the intense massage session, we went for a more western way of chilling drinking beer and playing pool at Lillian\u0026rsquo;s hostel. Here, we booked a 3 days trekking tour with homestay in different Hill tribe villages for the upcoming days.\nAnd to finish the day, we went to watch a Muay Thai combat. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell the age of the fighters but even though they looked very young, they went all-in to punch and kick each other. One of them ended up with a broken eyebrow, other with a twisted arm, and most of the others knocked out on the floor.\n DAY 13-14: Do you even backpack? For the next couple of days, I was on my own. Funny enough, it was the first time since I left home. The hostel in which I had spent the previous night was fully booked, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure where to go next. So I grabbed my big backpack with all my stuff and went into exploration mode (let me tell you, not the smartest idea!🤦‍♂️). While I was strolling through Chiang Mai, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist stopping in several of the hundreds of unique temples that decorate the city. Thanks to \u0026lsquo;my highly developed extroverted skills\u0026rsquo;, I was too sacred of talking to people. So for that day it was just me, my phone, and trash containers that I used as elevation points to take \u0026lsquo;selfies\u0026rsquo;.📸 After two or three hours of sun and sweat walking from the North Gate to the South Gate of the fortressed city, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk anymore. I stopped to enjoy the typical northern dish (Khao Soi) in a Mama\u0026rsquo;s stand. I found my self a hostel and stayed there just chilling for the rest of the evening.\nNext day, I had learned my lesson, I left the backpack at the hostel and rented a bicycle to move faster through the city. I was still a bit scared of renting a motorbike (since I had never driven one before). Even driving a regular bicycle through the chaotic traffic of Chiang Mai was scary as F!🚴‍♂️ I left the city whistling \u0026lsquo;Verano Azul\u0026rsquo; (only Spaniards will get the reference), while cycling through beautiful and green fields on the outskirts of CM. Finally, I arrived in a lake with several gigantic straw statues of different animals, including the majestic King Kong (not our previous guide but the gorilla🦍). I gather some of my courage and asked for my characteristic family picture. The problem was that the tourists around the area were Chinese who did not speak English, so it took me a long while until they understood what I wanted. They liked the idea tho, and they also took pictures with their cameras while still using the masks (Now, surely my family is decorating random Chinese houses).\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"410645bc91553f55ec12b2c287113f8f","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/1thailand/chiangmai/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/1thailand/chiangmai/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"Day 8: Chiang Mai (07/02/2019) The bus that brought me to Chiang Mai looked more like a disco than a real bus.

There, I took another bus to Chiang Rai, and fell asleep. When I woke up the bus had stopped in the middle of the road, it was already dark, and we were still quite far from Chiang Rai.\nMore than an hour later, I was starving. Nobody knew when we would resume our way, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist anymore and stepped out of the bus to find something to eat. As soon as a local lady was serving me a soup, the bus engine got fix (damn Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law!). It was funny that the local lady immediately poured the soup from the bowl into a plastic bag and handed it to me (one year later and I still have not learned how to eat soup from a plastic bag without making a big mess).\nThe following morning I met with Ella (one of the members from the farm family) who had also come to Chiang Rai, and we visited the three main attractions of the small town (white temple, blue temple, and black house). First, we took a local bus to go to Wat Rong Khun a.k.a. the white temple.\nActually, it is not a temple, but a piece of art funded and designed by the famous Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat. They often compare it to the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, as the artist has not finished it yet and it will take decades before that happens.\nI will not bore you with more details that you can find in Wikipedia, but this temple has so many details, and it is so unique, I believe is worth visiting it 100%. To come back we had to stand in the middle of the road until a small pick up truck brought us back to town. Since there was no space for everybody inside the small vehicle I had to ride it local style, standing outside, hanging from the metal bars.\nNext, we went to Baan Dam (not the actor) but the museum also known as the Black House. This museum has a bit of an obscure aura, decorated with a broad collection of skins, bones, teeth, and horns of a wide array of animals. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it that much, so rapidly we went into the last attraction.\nThis time, we had to run into a bus in the middle of the road, avoiding the traffic, as there were no bus stops and we already had missed two. One more time, no space for me, so I had to sit on the floor, next to the driver, bumping my as in every pothole of the road.\nThe blue temple (Wat Rong Suea Ten) is also one of the most beautiful and unique temples I have seen in Thailand. It was constructed very recently, and the designer is one of the students of Chalermchai (the designer of the white temple). Wikipedia for more info.\nTo finish the day we went to a roof top bar and see the sunset. There we met an American expat with a hyperactive kid. He was giving us some advice of what to do in the following days and I was entertaining the kid with a magic trick involving a coin that I learned form my dad🎩. We moved all together to a reggae bar, until the kid absorbed all my energies and I felt sleep.\nThe Chiang Rai post will continue, as I could recover more pictures and stories to tell. Today is spam day. And last one in Thailand.\n DAY 25-28: Chiang Rai Nature We rented bikes for the following two days to visit Chiang Rai surroundings. Another girl that Ella had met in her hostel joined us. She had been dating a Thai guy for two years and she could speak the language, which was quite useful to communicate with locals.\nThe first day we went to the South. We spent most of the day in a park with many different kinds of flowers. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much about that park, only that food was very expensive, and (from the only picture I have recovered) that yellow flowers🌻 fit fabulously on me🤣.\nAfter that, we went waterfall hunting, but it was getting late and we had to settle for a refreshing deep on the river. On the way back to Chiang Rai we stopped to have dinner in a restaurant that had tables floating on the river. To finish the day, we went to observe a light spectacle at the clock tower in the main square of the town. Thousands of birds were flying around the lights of the tower. With the dark background of the night, it felt even more magical, like if they were dancing stars💫 .\nThe last day we went North. We were supposed to find a small village where people live in harmony with elephants🐘, but the elephants that we saw were in chains so we left the place rapidly. We kept going up the road, driving through hills covered with rice paddies of an intense green color that didn\u0026rsquo;t seem real.\nWe were hoping to find natural hot springs to chill and spend the afternoon. Once again we were disappointed with what we found. The hot springs were there, but they stink to sulfur and were boiling hot🔥 . At some point, we heard some noises and we found that the hot springs reached a river where local kids were playing. We spent the rest of the day swimming with them.\nOn the way back we stop for sunset next to the rice paddies.

Most people stop here to take a slow boat through the Mekong that will take them to Luang Prabang. I was tempted to do it, but a friend from the farm (@jackedz89 ) had recommended me something different, the gibbon experience.\nIt was a bit pricy, but as a \u0026lsquo;Tarzan wannabe\u0026rsquo; I had to try it, and you know what YOLO!🐒 For the next couple of days, we would be hiking in the jungle, moving around using zip lines to cross between mountains. And we would spend the night in a treehouse. Exciting!!🤩\nI remember that soon after starting the hike through the jungle I saw a goat with two babies. They got scared and the mum goat ran away. One of the babies, decided that I would be her new mum and started to follow me (my own mum used to call me \u0026ldquo;mountain goat\u0026quot;🐐 when I was younger, so I understand the animal confusion). Luckily we found the real mum and continued our way.\nZiplining over the trees was quite exciting, but there were too many safety rules and at some point became repetitive. I decided to spice things up a little bit trying different flying postures, but the guides didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to like it🙈.\nWe arrived at the tree-house to enjoy the sunset from the top. Followed by a quite tasty dinner, and night of games. I especially connected with two amazing couples Kasia \u0026amp; Arame, and Bhav \u0026amp; Rajvi. They had been backpacking for a longer time and served me as inspiration for the subsequent months of my journey (Bhav also had a quite long beard and inspired me to grow mine🧔).\nSpending the night in the treehouse was pretty cool but also a bit scary, as that night there was a storm and I could feel the tree shaking. Plus, some rats invaded the house overnight to see if they could steal some food leftovers, and we could hear them running around.🐁\nThe next morning we woke up early to see the sunrise, and the guides tried to take us to an area where sometimes you can see Gibbons (as expected there was no luck).\nIn exchange, they showed us a special bark of a tree that is used for fireworks (the video is slowed down, but in real-time you could see the fire in the air for a couple seconds too).

Around 100km in, I laid down in an empty bamboo hut next to the road. Several local men saw me and came towards me. I thought I was in trouble but they wanted to invite me for drinks and to play karaoke with them. They didn\u0026rsquo;t accept a NO for an answer but I was not able to sing their Khmer songs either🤷🏻‍♂️. After a couple of hours, I told them I had to go or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it to Kampot, but they were drunk and didn\u0026rsquo;t want me to go. I had to lie, promising I would visit them back on my return.\nThat harmless lie turned my life into Hell, as a couple of Km later the road turned into pebbles and sand making it almost impossible to ride. On top of that, cars and trucks would pass raising huge clouds of dust that swallowed me. I thought that would be over soon, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more wrong.

We spent most of our forth day in a very slow bus with direction to Kanchanaburi. The city is mainly known for historical events during WWII described in the book and movie with the title \u0026ldquo;Bridge on the river Kwai\u0026rdquo;. It is also very close to some amazing waterfalls. However, not many western people visit the area.\nOnce we arrived, in our dorm we met François, a french guy travelling alone with his motorbike. And together we planned how to organize the following days.\nNext morning we had to wake up early, go to the middle of the road, and hail a bus that would take us to the Erawan Waterfalls. At that time, I was expecting the bus to be empty, but on the contrary, there were no space left to sit. Until a friendly monk in the back of the bus made signs for me to get closer, created space so I could seat next to him. We echanged smiles and he went back to sleep.\nErawan Waterfalls are composed by 7 different levels, with only two things in common: clear turquoise water and curious fishes that loved to swim next to you, and even nibble the skin of your feet if you stand still.\nTo reach each level we had to do some hiking. And even though it was recommended to do use proper shoes I decided to go \u0026ldquo;tarzan-mode\u0026rdquo; and do it barefoot.\nAfter a full day of swimming with fishes, climbing some lianas, doing yoga poses under a big waterfall, and running after monkeys through the jungle, I needed a feet massage. So we chilled with our feet in the water while small fishes gave us a free peeling session (it took me at least 15 min to get used to it).\nWhen it started to go dark, we said good bye to François who was going deeper into the National park with his motorbike, and we got the bus to come back. Once again there was no space for me, and this time I had to sit in the middle of the bus corridor, next to the driver. Some bumpy roads msde me think I would go flying through the windshield, but thanfully I made it in one piece to enjoy delicious local food at Kanchanaburi\u0026rsquo;s night market.\n BONUS: FAMILY in my backpack First time I asked Thai people to wear the masks of my family. Curious fact, they fight each other because they all wanted to wear female masks\u0026hellip; Is my dad so ugly? Or maybe it was the excitement of being a ladyboy for a couple of minutes? 😅\n DAY 6: The Death Railway The most popular feature of Kanchanaburi is the bridge over the river Kwai, and the numerous memorials to the prisoners of war who died building the Burma railway.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s plan was to ride a train through the \u0026ldquo;Death Railway\u0026rdquo; starting at the famous bridge all the way to Hellfire pass. To get a better idea of what happened there, the night before I spent a couple of hours reading some interesting facts and watching the 1957 movie.\nOnce in the train, I had the chance to throw some random comments in front of a couple of americans, that amazed by my \u0026ldquo;wikipedia knowledge\u0026rdquo;, wanted to hire me as their guide for the day.\nThe bridge in itself is not a big deal. In fact, it is not even similar to the one displayed in the movie (which was recorded in Sri Lanka). That is a bit disappointing. However, there is a part of the trajectory that runs between a river and a clift where the views are spectacular. Furthermore, since there is only one train every 3 hours, people are allowed to walk through the rails and enjoy the views.\nSomething to highlight is that next to this train station I eat the best coconut ice cream ever!!\nBack in the hostel I still had some cravings for fruit, so I bought a whole pineapple (my favorite fruit in Thailand so far) for 50 cents and they taught me how to cut it Thai style.\nLater, we had dinner with 3 new people from our dorm and one of them told us how easy had been for him to hitchhike everywhere in the SE of Asia\u0026hellip;Now I want to try it too!\n DAY 7: A Bike Ride Our last day in Kanchanaburi, Tess and I rented bicycles (we were a bit afraid of renting scooters) to do a 40 km exploration tour around the surrounding areas of the city.\nAt first, it felt kind of dangerous to jump into the road, where all the cars and motorbikes didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to respect any traffic law. Especially, because my bike didn\u0026rsquo;t have breaks and I had to stop by setting on fire the sole of my shoes.\nHowever, as soon as I got used to drive on the left side, I realized that despite the dominant and aggressive \u0026ldquo;Thai way\u0026rdquo; of driving, they are really aware of everything going on and I felt completely safe.\nIn our first stop we ride our bikes through an out-of-use small version of hellfire memorial. Then, with the bikes on our shoulders we climbed several steps to reach a viewpoint over the river Kwae.\nIn the mid point of our journey we found a gigantic monkey pod tree. At this point Tessa wanted to go back to the city, but I was determined to complete the circuit, so we splited ways.\nDuring the rest of the way, I waved \u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo; to every local I met, which almost cost me falling from the bike a couple of times. Surprised of seeing me riding a bicycle on the bumpy and boiling hot roads, they laughed while waving back.\nIn fact, I got severely burned, but the dragon themed temples of Ban Tham \u0026amp; Than Phaet temples, located in the top of two mountains, made it all worth. . After the intense work out to get to the top of the mountains I only wanted a relaxing ride back while enjoying the views. But a group of dogs, well prepared to bite my legs, decided against it and chased me for a long time. . The worst part is that when I finally lost them, my back tire exploded. And even though some locals tried to help me, I had to pull my bike back for at least 30 min.\nWhen I arrived to the hostel, I met a group of cool guys from USA and Switzerland. And before taking a night bus towards my first city of the North (Chiang Mai) , we spent the rest of the afternoon sharing experiences while eating refreshing pineapple.\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"b2278a4d4db8375106d7fb51f3d355b0","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/1thailand/kanchanaburi/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/1thailand/kanchanaburi/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"Day 4: Erawan Waterfalls (02/02/2019) Before heading to the North part of Thailand, Tess and I decided to visit one more city from the middle region.

I was planning to get some fresh seafood there, but they convinced me to go with them to eat \u0026ldquo;the best chicken with pepper ever\u0026rdquo; and then visit a nearby French pepper plantation.\nIn \u0026ldquo;La Plantation\u0026rdquo;, they gave us a free tour, including an exotic pepper tasting.

That morning, my french friend @lilian.aoust and I got up early to embark on a 3 days expedition into the nearby mountains. We thought we would be part of a large group but it ended up being just the 2 of us. On the way there, we stopped to do water rafting, which sounded very promising but ended up being quite disappointing as the river was no more than a couple feet deep, and the boat moved extremely slow.\nSoon after, we got introduced to our guide, King Kong, who guided us through a short hike into one of the villages that inhabit those remote hills. There, they assigned us to a family that would host us for the following nights. What made it interesting was that the only English word they could pronounce was \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Hello\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; whenever they wanted to catch our attention. King Kong was our only chance of communicating with them, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t stick around for too long. Nevertheless, we had a great time. We watched the sunset while getting a Thai massage from one of the elders of the tribe, I woke up with the roosters to see the sunrise, we hiked, and I tried for the first time drinking water from a river using my LifeStraw (it sucked!). The rest of the time, I mainly played with the kids of the family, helping them with some English homework and learning about the different minorities that inhabit Thailand. In particular, we were in a village of the Lahu, and coincidentally, that night, they were celebrating their New Year. We gathered around a stick in the middle of the main square. The kids played with fire crackers, the elder played some weird looking instruments and the rest, we danced in circles for hours.\nBefore we left I asked them for a family picture :)\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"6263d2718f4200e811c25c1958e8a290","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/1thailand/lahu/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/1thailand/lahu/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"DAY 10: HOMESTAY WITH THE LAHU🎄 It has been more than a year since I started my backpacking adventure, and almost the same time since I stopped updating my journal.

When the bus came, after several hours waiting for it, and I stepped inside\u0026hellip; No seats. What? It was a sleeping bus, the \u0026lsquo;best\u0026rsquo; part is that the beds are quite small, and on top of that you have to share them, so much fun!! Apart from that, the views during the long ride were astonishing. Sadly, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recover any of those pictures. I could recover something better tho. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually share pictures of food, but I know you all will be jealous of my nutritious bowl of silkworms pupae. Yummy!😋\nUntil that point, I thought I was the only foreigner on the bus, but a French guy, Baptiste, joined me for the silkworm feast.\nHours later we arrived at Luang Namtha bus station, which is several kilometers away from the town. And at those later hours, we were just fresh meat for the tuk-tuk hyenas trying to rip us off to take us to town.\nThe next day, we agreed on booking a 2day survival experience package together that would start early the next morning. For the rest of the day, I rented a bicycle and rode South. I remember how I started the ride with a feeling of solitude, but after a few minutes of riding the bike🚴, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop meeting kids with big smiles surprised by seeing a European in their small poor villages.\nI ended up chilling with a few of them for sunset next to a river where a fisherman was trying to catch something for dinner. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t communicate with them at all, but they seemed to enjoy my company. Riding back to the guesthouse the feeling of solicitude had flipped to one of the most vibrant and emotionally filling moments of my trip🥰\nNote: I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recover the pictures of these days so I include photos that resemble my memories of what happened.\n ##DAY 6: Survival Experience (01/03/19)\nTo become a real Tarzan I had to learn how to survive in the jungle. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more excited about the experience that was about to come.\nWe would spend the next couple of days hiking through the protected jungle of Nam Ha, learning about edible plants🌱, collecting food🍱, and building our own tent to sleep under🏕️. Of the two guides that came with us, only one spoke English, but both were extremely amazing and complemented each other with their skills.\nOne of them would tell us stories, teach us about their religion (animism) based on the existence of spirits in all our surroundings, and gave us to try different stuff to eat from whatever we found around. That was my first time to eat a handful of giant red ants🐜 (they taste like lemon).\nThe other one was very skilled at building stuff, most of them using bamboo🎍🐼. Apparently, there are many kinds. With one kind, he helped us building walking sticks, another type you can eat it, and with others, you can for example build a \u0026lsquo;bong'🤣. From all the jungles I have visited so far, Nam Ha has been the one that brought me the closest feeling of being inside Jurassic Park.\nIt would not have surprised me to find a T-Rex randomly walking around🦖. When the sunset was getting close it was time to start building our tents. As you can guess the main components were bamboo for the structure but also cut in very thin slices we used it as strings. And the final touch a couple of banana leaves for the roof and the floor. After the tent was finished, we got some thicker bamboo and used it as pots for cooking and plates to serve the meal. And for dessert, the guides went to the river and got us crabs and small fish using only a machete.\nThe experience was great, but the night was horrible. I could have never expected that sleeping on the floor of a jungle would be so cold and uncomfortable 🙄\nBack in Luang Namtha one of the guides came for dinner with Batiste and me. We played petanque (Lao favorite sport), sang in a karaoke, and he told us more stories about how he built his own house by himself, and about how Lao people don\u0026rsquo;t care much about the physical appearance but the feelings of the heart. It would have been a beautiful message if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that he was getting completely wasted with two strangers while his wife was alone at home taking care of their baby.

It turns out that a huge part of the Lao population cannot read at all📖. Furthermore, recently they also open their own school and were looking for people to volunteer there.\nThe next morning I went with them again, and they took me to the outskirts of the city where they hosted more than 200 students. We played with the kids while teaching them some English, and some of the older ones tried to teach me how to ride a monocycle (obviously I failed🤦‍♂️).\nTo finish the day, I met with my French friends couple, we rented bikes and went to visit a buffalo farm.

We gather red flowers from banana trees, banana tree stem, and some roots similar to potatoes.

I thought he wanted me to pray, so I explained to him I am not religious, but that I would join him if he wanted to go.\nAfter a brief ride, we were back in the temple, and when we entered one of the buildings I almost cried when I saw a group of another 20 international volunteers that had finally arrived😭. Yuhuuu!!🥳🙌\nThere we would meet Pi Nan, a former monk that married a Japanese woman and now they dedicated their lives in developing these mindful farms.\nFor the following days, most of us would live at basic rooms on the monastery, except Pi Nan and me.

Pi Nan also instructed in meditation and mindfulness. Some of the tasks included sweeping all the leaves from the monastery (so much fun!🧹🍂), and eating in silence (that was hard for a Spanish guy).

The whole town was basically a straight line, not bungalows next to the river. It is not very developed yet and you still can interact with locals or with kids that after school go to play to the river. Our first day we just relaxed and chill there.\nFor dinner, we met a young Swedish guy who met a local woman and moved there 10 years ago. He told us that we should also check the nearby traditional villages. As in one of them, someone had passed away and they were going to hold a celebration.\nThe next day, Tanguy, Lisa, Ella and I, went hiking to explore the surroundings.

As a consequence, most of them have learned to defend themselves being stone cold. Personally, now I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend volunteering in a place like this for short periods of time.\nAlso, the place was not what I had in mind. More than the typical orphanage you see in movies this was something similar to a farm. In fact, more than once, the kids would miss our English lessons to go feed the goats or cows on the field.\nMy initial plan was staying only a couple of days, but I ended up extending it to a week. During that time I tried to earn a little space in their hearts, giving them as much love as I could, trying to fix their old bikes, letting them ride mine, helping them with the early morning chores, feeding the animals, playing games and trying to inspire them to pursue their objectives in life.\nSome of the boys responded well and invited me to some of their activities, including taking outdoors showers with a bucket in a nearby fountain. However, the girls hated me since the first minute and there was nothing I could do to change that. Luckily I was not alone, Sandra was the other volunteer in the school. It was good to have additional support with the kids, and she had more success than me with the girls.\nI am missing several anecdotes of the 7 days I spent in this place. I still have many good memories but I also remember the pain of their constant rejection of having me around. So after the 7 days, I realized it was time to go!

Next morning Darila(@darila_ ), Hippo (@hippolyte.v), and me, decided to hitchhike back to Chiang Mai👍. Despite my sexy pose, Hippo was the one that got a Thai lady to give us a ride. She did speak that much English, but she was super excited to have us aboard. She did not only drop us at the bus station, but also came to help us buy the tickets to Pai, all in exchange for a picture together.\nThe ride between Chaing Mai and Pai was intense, 762 vomit-inducing curves🤮 (little did I know that I would be repeating that trip a couple more times in the future). Until now, I had resisted being another tourist buying elephant baggy pants or t-shirts. But somehow Pai influenced me. Pai is considered the Thai hippie paradise, with a laid-back atmosphere, a fire circus, lots of yoga, delicious food, and surrounded by beautiful nature.\nThe hippie vibe started to grow on me (like my hair and my beard🧔), and I ended up getting my first Aladin pants and elephant tank top🧞. Another first experience to add in Pai was driving a bike (followed by my first accident too, but that will come later).\nI wanted to drive a scooter for a long time, but I kept hearing negative opinions on how dangerous the roads are in Thailand, how the Thai police are there to get you if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the correct driver\u0026rsquo;s license, etc. However, Philip (@so_ein_baertiger_tuep), who had come from Chiang Mai to Pai driving a rented bike, convinced me to give it a try letting me his. I will be eternally grateful as that moment changed my whole trip🛵.\nFor the following days, the farm gang (Dilara, Hippo, Philip, Yvonne (@yvonnevanzyl1) and Ella) would rent our own bikes and went exploring Pai\u0026rsquo;s surrounding areas. A traditional Chinese village (tourist trap, they scummed us in the only restaurant and threatened us to call the police if we did not pay), waterfalls (sadly they were a bit dry), the Land Split, the Pai WWII memorial bridge, and the two most iconic highlights the Withe Buddha, and the Pai Canyon.\nHowever, the best memories of those days in Pai are all the moments we spent together, connecting (since on the farm we were too busy working and eating mindfully), watching sunsets and sunrises and making the promise that even our journeys would split soon we would meet again🌄.\nBut, wait!! What happened with the motorbike accident?💥 I have to admit it was my fault, after the first day driving, I felt so secure of my skills that I permitted myself to constantly check the phone while driving to look at the map. Surprisingly, that was not the cause of the accident, but it gave me a false sense of security.\nIt was Philip last day and we went far North to enjoy a relaxing day of hot springs. They turned out to be quite expensive so we decided to go to a random location of the map that also pointed to a hot spring. We ended up in a semi-abandoned village, we trespassed into a local\u0026rsquo;s farm (as the map indicated that was the way) and kept walking until someone caught us and asked us to leave (it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem we were going to find the hot spring anyway).\nOn the way back, we found a police control, I was a bit/lot scared💩 as I don\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of driving license, luckily they were only looking for drugs and we could resume our paths.\nAll the excitement made us hungry, and we were looking for a place to stop and eat. I saw one, and turned my head back for 3 sec to point the rest of the gang that we could stop there. Those 3 sec were enough for my bike to deviate left, towards a big patch of sand, lose control of my bike, fall on the road, and be droved over by Hippo who was a bit too close to me.\nLuckily I only got some scratches and injured my wrists for the following month. It was a good wake up call to be more conscious while on the road, but it did not stop me from keep driving bikes.\nThat last day Philip reminded us how powerful it is to compliment each other, so we shared beautiful and positive words before saying good bye.\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"2234d02dabe0aec3e521cedf9696be47","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/1thailand/pai/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/1thailand/pai/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"DAY 21-24: The Farm Gang moves to Pai.

She asked me to take off my clothes and started the massage. It was quite bad and in \u0026lt;15min she asked me to turn around. That was a bit early but it was my first massage in Cambodia and maybe they had a different style. She started to climb up my legs rather fast. She reached a bit too high for my liking, but I was willing to trust her. That was the moment when pointing at my \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; she asked: \u0026ldquo;Happy?\u0026rdquo; -No, no happy! -Then, finish!

And it was, but not in the expected way.\nThe first day in Siem Reap, Tanguy, Lisa and I walked a bit around town and bought some souvenirs. Among them, I bought some blue Alibaba style pants to increase the hippie-homeless looks that I was starting to display.\nThat afternoon we also arranged a tuk-tuk ride that would take us the next day around Angkor Wat, and he even took us there already to see the sunset beforehand.\nI was staying at a different hostel, so the next morning I had to wake up very early (4 am) to meet them at their hostel and start our journey to see the sunrise at the majestic Temple. Our driver was getting late and a different tuk-tuk driver who had followed me, tried to convince us to go with him instead. He was very persistent and was getting very annoying so I told him to -fuck off- and left us in peace. He didn\u0026rsquo;t. When our driver came, we were so thrilled to lose sight of the other guy that we jumped in with haste.\nI should have noticed faster, but as we were taking off, I saw the annoying driver staring at me while picking something from the floor, rushing to his tuk-tuk, and disappearing in the dark. I immediately checked my pockets, I was wearing the Alibaba pants I just bought the day before, the pockets were too wide and when I jumped in our tuk-tuk my phone had fallen. I asked our driver to go back and try to chase the other guy, but it was too late.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make my friends pay for my mistake, so we end up driving to Angkor Wat. I must say that the temple complex is impressive. And given that March is the hottest month, the attraction is not as packed with tourists as it uses to. However, the heat was extenuating, and my head was more focused on how to recover my phone than in enjoying the architectonic wonder of the Khmer Empire.\nBefore finishing the day I start to realize the symptoms of addiction and I cannot wait till the next day to go to the police and hopefully recover my phone. How could I know things only were going to get worse\u0026hellip;\n DAY 4: Change of plans (29/03/19) For the next couple of days, I tried reporting the theft of my phone to the police, but no fucks were given. Someone suggested I should have showed them some money, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to push my luck and end up in another dark room.\nAlso, I was experiencing the withdrawal symptoms of phone addiction😵. In a different case, this could have been therapeutic, but right now the phone was my life. Nowadays, a backpacker🎒uses the phone for everything, contacting family and friends, navigating through cities, documenting the trip with pictures, booking transportation and accommodation, or even basic stuff like checking the time or setting an alarm.\nIn sights of the impossibility of recovering my phone, I had to decide whether buying a local phone (but I didn\u0026rsquo;t trust those and they were not that cheap) or ordering one on-line. But I already had lost many days to stay even longer in Siem Reap waiting for the phone. So I decided I would embrace the old way, I would travel for one month with no TECH!📵\nBut in my delusion that was not challenging enough, on top of that I would rent a bicycle🚴‍♂️ (remember we are in the hottest month of the year and I have not exercised for months) and I would ride through the country visiting random villages and staying to sleep in houses of random people\u0026hellip;\nI was committed, so I visited several bicycle rental stores until I found one that agreed on my idea (most of them thought I was crazy and they would never see their bike again). I also went to buy some patches, an extra tire, and an inflator, just in case. I bought a small notebook, a watch, and a pre-COVID face mask for the dust on the road.\nI was already mentally prepared to go on the adventure when I met Facundo, and Argentinian guy of my hostel that told me about his experience volunteering in a nearby orphanage. It sounded interesting so I thought my long tour could wait and I would spend a couple days in the orphanage too.\nThe night before going to the orphanage, I went out with Facundo to the Pub he used to work.

The scenery is gorgeous and the trail is packed with caves and limestone cliffs.\nThe highlight of the loop is the Konglor Cave🏞️, referred to as one of the Asian wonders. It is 7km deep and filled with water so you need to ride a boat to visit the inside🚣‍♂️.\nI started the ride very excited and amazed by the beautiful sights, little did I know that some awful things were about to happen😣\nDuring the first day, after I have visited a couple of caves, I stopped for lunch in a waterfall area. The waterfalls were dry, but there were some pits full of water in which you could swim. At some point, a group of locals who carried huge speakers showed up.\nThey invited me to join them and gave me food and snacks. Then, the males started climbing a cliff and jumping from the top. They invited me to do the same, and I had the brightest idea to record the jump with my GoPro. I was not using that much, so I thought it would be a good time. It was not! It was not properly fixed and when I hit the water it was the last time I saw it🤦‍♂️\nWe tried diving but it was too deep and too blurry to see anything. Also, it was getting dark and I had to keep moving, so I decided that instead of completing the loop, the last day I would return the same way, I would buy a diving mask and I would find my GoPro📷.\nBy night, I arrived at a hostel near a damp. The dead trees raising from within the waters all around that area had a mystic but creepy vibe at the same time. That night we had an amazing barbeque and I met some people to ride along the next day. We visited some more caves and stopped for lunch in a natural pool. One more time, young locals showed up, and by this time I was starting to think that jumping from heights was their traditional hobby, because as if they were monkeys, they climbed a very hight thin tree 🌴🐒 and started to show off in front of the girls.\nI would have stayed longer to enjoy the spectacle, but if I wanted to make it in time to visit the Konglor Cave that day and try finding my camera the next day I had to rush!!\nI jumped in my bike and drove as fast as I could, as someone just warned me the cave was closing soon. One of the last sections of the road was a straight line, a good road, no cars, so I sped up to 90km/h. I was going to make it!\nProbably that thought distracted me and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it, a big pothole appeared in the middle of the road. By the time I wanted to react it was too late. I knew I couldn\u0026rsquo;t dodge it, so I braked and held into my bike as strong as I could. It didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nLife got slow-mo and I flew like Superman. That could have been it, but it was not my time. I was wearing helmet, long pants and hard shoes, that protected me and I only ended up with some nasty scratches and a little stone stuck deep into my arm. The bike was not doing much better than me but it was still working. I patched myself and kept driving. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t let that accident be for nothing.\nThe rest of the drive I still had to go fast, but way more careful as the road quality was getting worse, full of bumps and holes. When I finally made it to the caves, they were closing already. But I may or may have not given them some scary looks and they made an exception and let me go in. In the end, everything was worth it!!\nThat night I should have probably gone to a nice guesthouse. Have a good clean if my wounds, a nice bed and rest well. But I don\u0026rsquo;t follow the common sense. I decided to go for a Homestay, that means go spend the night in a house with a local family, not much electricity, shower with a bucket and a mat on the floor with a mosquito net around it👌🏻\nThe kids of the family were a bit shocked when they saw all my injuries. Probably they told all their friends, as the next morning all the kids in the town were outside the house trying to have a glimpse of me. The family also helped me to fix my bike a bit, although, by its looks, I already knew I would have to pay a lot of fees when I returned it.\nOn the way back, I had to stop in more than 10 villages to finally find a diving mask. And when I found one, the owners probably didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what it was for, but they knew it was expensive and they wanted to make some money. After a long negotiation, I still paid more than what I should have paid but I was committed to finding my GoPro.\nI arrived at the waterfall area, put my mask on, removed my bloody bandages, and risking getting infected with the dirty waters I spent more than 1hour diving in. But the pit was too deep and too blurry to see anything. That was my first lesson of detachment, just let go, the camera was not of vital importance anyway. Maybe these 3 days were just packed with lessons I had to learn, and now the only thing left to do was to keep traveling\u0026hellip;🤩\n Go back to travel directory\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"ad8f341f39c3286662a037a721ecb97d","permalink":"https://example.com/blog_travel/2laos/thakhek/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog_travel/2laos/thakhek/","section":"blog_travel","summary":"DAY 21: Thakhek Loop (17/03/19) ⚠️This story is just a summary but it is going to be a long one!\nGoing all the way to the South of Laos there is a 3day loop driving with the motorbike🛵.

A great advantage of being 4 was the possibility of splitting the price of hiring a tuk-tuk (my first tuk-tuk) so they would move or lazy asses from one temple to the next one. . Less shiny, that their Bangkok counterparts, Wat Mahathat and Wat Chaiwatthanaram display the weathered and colossal buildings, now in ruins, that once upon a time constituted the grand palace of the Kingdom.

You don\u0026rsquo;t need to walk more than 5 min from the station to feel you have entered the movie Jumanji, as the streets are dominated by wild monkeys.\nIn particular, they have made the old temple of Phra Pang Sam Got their home, and they won\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to jump on you to steal as many of your belongings they can grab. I wanted to get a couple of them on me for the laughs, but knowing my luck on these matters I could see myself going back home with rabies the second day of my trip.
